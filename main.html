<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity describes how the runtime of an algorithm changes as the input size grows. 
        It helps us evaluate how efficient an algorithm is in different scenarios. 
        Understanding Time complexity is essential for writing efficient code.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires as the input size increases. 
        When we analyze Space Complexity, we often express it using notations like O(n) to show how memory usage grows.
